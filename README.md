# Agents

In the era of Agentic programming we often see agents building sphagetti code with less regards to maintainability. Even though the code works, debugging it becomes a nightmare during those repeated inifinite iterations of hallucinations where only adding a single `;` could fix the problem. Yes one can add their own custom *AGENTS.md* or *CLAUDE.md* file but often a times a lot of the guidances are common for a specific toolset. This repo is a collection of all such toolset based common agentic rules.
